Are you one of those who hate any distraction while watching a movie or web series as you may miss an interesting or important scene. To tackle this here I have made a #computervision based model, which pause the video for you whenever you get distracted, not only this but it also play it for you when you start looking back to screen. Thanks Rahul Shrivastava for the idea! I think video player should have this feature, what's your view in this? Please like,share and comment!  #computervision #deeplearning #neuralnetworks #aiforeveryone #mxplayer #netflixindia #amazonprimevideo
